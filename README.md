## Tentacular!

**Tentacles made of bubbles in SVG!**

Inspired by the beautiful artwork of Amelia Caruso.  
Of course, I won't be able to match that in any way.  
But, you know, inspired.

### Installation:
First, install yarn. Look that up [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).
Then, just:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Then point your browser at `http://localhost:3000` and look at pretty tentacles. When it's done, at least.
